1. Only can override 'public' method in parent's method.
2. Cannot override 'private' method in parent's method.

when want to override methods which in parent class, 
you cannot let the power become 'limit' 
however, you can let it become more powerful 
here is the example code. 

public class Car { 
	private void test_private() {

	}

	public void test_public() {

	} 
} 


public class RacingCar extends Car { 

	public void test_private() { 
		//ok 
	} 

	private void test_public() {
		//not ok 
	}
}
