**This is bold text**When you want to create a new object but it will be costly. You can use ** prototype patten ** to achieve it. The difference between the factory patten and prototype pattern is the prototype pattern will create (or clone) the object an advance. But factory patten will create (or new) in the runtime. So when create a similar object will cast lot of effor like access database. It is the prefect timing to use prototype pattern.
