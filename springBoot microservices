**** relevant knowledge (webcline) using asynchronize way **** 


1. restTemplets --> call url and get string response
	get from object

perfectly ok to create repeated classes

2. beans in spring are by default singletons
 --> @Bean
 
3. autowired --> somebody has bean annotation, inject to me
--> @Autowired

4. we should avoid returning a list object

5. rest Apis are thread safe, but DB is not 

6. server side discovery --> client calls discovery server and then this server passes the message to the atcural service
   client side discovery --> client calls discoevry server and gets response and then calls the atcural service
  
   **** spring cloud uses client side discovery  ******
   Eureka client and server
