**** relevant knowledge (webcline) using asynchronize way **** 


1. restTemplets --> call url and get string response
	get from object

perfectly ok to create repeated classes

2. beans in spring are by default singletons
 --> @Bean
 
3. autowired --> somebody has bean annotation, inject to me
--> @Autowired

4. we should avoid returning a list object

5. rest Apis are thread safe, but DB is not
