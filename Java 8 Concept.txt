** Stream **

1. Simply put, streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and making bulk processing convenient and fast.

2. A stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.

3. This new functionality – java.util.stream – supports functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections.
